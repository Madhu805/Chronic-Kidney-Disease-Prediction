Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major public health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to classify whether a patient has CKD based on various health parameters.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Madhu805/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ckd-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset:

Download the CKD dataset from the source.
Place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Train the model:
python train_model.py


Evaluate the model:
python evaluate_model.py
Make predictions on new data:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input new_data.csv
Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes the dataset for training.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model using techniques like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.
Prediction: Predicts CKD on new patient data.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains 400 instances with 25 attributes, including demographic and laboratory results. The dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Model
The model is built using a combination of feature engineering and machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the following:

Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks (optional)
You can switch between models by updating the config.py file.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. Detailed performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be found in the results/ folder.
